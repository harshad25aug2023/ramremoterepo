 "mike  says you want to learn make money? Is that correct ,Robert?"
I nodded my head quickly,but with litttle trepidation . He had 
a lot of power behind his word and smile.
     "Okay,hear is my offer.I'll teach you, but i won't do it classroomstyle.
You work for me , I'll teach you.You don't work for me ,I won't teach you. I can teach you 
faster if you work, and I'am wasting my time if you just want to sit and listen like you
do in school.That's offer .Take it or leave it."
  
     "Ah ,may i aske a question first? I asked.
     "No.TAke it or leave it.I've got to much work to do to waste
my time.  If you can't up your mind decisively, then you'll never 
learn to make money anyway . Opportunities come and go. Being able 
to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill. You have
the opportunity that you asked for.School is beginning,or it's over in
10 second ,"Mike's dad said with a teasing smile .
        "Take it,"I siad.
        "Take it,"said Mike. 
        "Good ," said Mike's dad . "Mrs.Martin will be by in 10 minutes.
After I'm through with her, you'll ride with her to my superette and 
you can begain working.I'll pay you 10 cents an hour, and you'll work 
three hours every Saturaday."
        But I have a softball game today," I said.
        Mike's dad lowered his voice to a stern tone."Take it, or leave it,"
he said .
"I'll take it,"I replied,choosing to work and learn instead of playing.
